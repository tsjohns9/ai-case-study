# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Deepgram

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was founded in 2015

* Who are the founders of the company?

Scott Stephenson, Noah Shutty, Adam Sypniewski

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founders were particle physicists working in underground labs in china two miles underground to detect dark matter. They were working to build a dark matter detector underground to provide a very quiet environment to conduct their experiments. The idea was to have nothing happen inside the isolated environment, and if something happens, then they would identify that as dark matter. The experiment is sensitive and they work with waveforms that are similar to audo waveforms. It is similar to doing real time recording of many conversations at one time. They had to do machine learning in real time on the wave forms that look like audio wave forms, and figure out what is happening in the detector in real time to make decisions about it. That kind of thinking and technology led to deepgram. They ended up making little devices to record audio all day and ended up with a thousand hours of audio. They wanted to find interesting moments from the audio, and they went and looked for a product that could do that, but they couldn't find it. They tried taking the audio to Google and Microsoft to talk to their speech experts to understand what is in the audio, and they were told that it would be too hard to use deep learning to do that with languages and it wouldn't work. After that they decided to start the company

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

They are currently on their Series B funding where they raised $72 million dollars. Overall, they have raised $86 million dollars.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Deepgram is trying to make it easy to accurately transcribe and analyze audio data. Their main offering  is transcripting audio text because human generated transcripts are slow and expensive, and legacy solutions have their limitations as to what they can understand from voice data. Their technology offers speech recognition, sentiment analysis, speaker labeling, topic detection, and translation to other languages. This provides their customers to gain deep insight into whatever audio data they have.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The market size is estimated at $20 billion dollars and it is anticipated to grow 14.6% until 2030. This growth is expected because of the current adoption of speech recognition technology in various markets.

Deepgram is targeting enterprises that need speech recognition and audio analysis. They have customers in healthcare, finance, retail, and technology, and they have partnered with large scale communication and conferencing providers.

They also target software developers by offering an API that is easy to integrate into different kinds of projects for different programming languages. The API provides developers with the tools to add speech recognition and audio analysis into their applications.
