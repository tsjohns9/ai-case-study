# AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

The company I researched is called Deepgram. They are a voice AI platform that provides APIs to translate audio to text. The company was founded in 2015 by Scott Stephenson, Noah Shutty, Adam Sypniewski. They are currently on their Series B funding where they raised $72 million dollars. Overall, they have raised $86 million dollars.

The founders were particle physicists working in underground labs in china two miles underground to detect dark matter. They were working to build a dark matter detector underground to provide a very quiet environment to conduct their experiments. The idea was to have nothing happen inside the isolated environment, and if something happens, then they would identify that as dark matter. The experiment is sensitive and they work with waveforms that are similar to audo waveforms. It is similar to doing real time recording of many conversations at one time. They had to do machine learning in real time on the wave forms that look like audio wave forms, and figure out what is happening in the detector in real time to make decisions about it.

That kind of thinking and technology led to deepgram. They ended up making little devices to record audio all day and ended up with a thousand hours of audio. They wanted to find interesting moments from the audio, and they went and looked for a product that could do that, but they couldn't find it. They tried taking the audio to Google and Microsoft to talk to their speech experts to understand what is in the audio, and they were told that it would be too hard to use deep learning to do that with languages and it wouldn't work. After that they decided to start the company.

## Business Activities

Deepgram is trying to make it easy to accurately transcribe and analyze audio data. Their main offering  is transcripting audio text because human generated transcripts are slow and expensive, and legacy solutions have their limitations as to what they can understand from voice data. Their technology offers speech recognition, sentiment analysis, speaker labeling, topic detection, and translation to other languages. This provides their customers to gain deep insight into whatever audio data they have.

The market size is estimated at $20 billion dollars and it is anticipated to grow 14.6% until 2030. This growth is expected because of the current adoption of speech recognition technology in various markets.

Deepgram is targeting enterprises that need speech recognition and audio analysis. They have customers in healthcare, finance, retail, and technology, and they have partnered with large scale communication and conferencing providers.

They also target software developers by offering an API that is easy to integrate into different kinds of projects for different programming languages. The API provides developers with the tools to add speech recognition and audio analysis into their applications.

The biggest competitor to Deepgram is OpenAI Whisper. Deepgram's solution is 36% more accurate, 5x faster, and costs less than OpenAI Whisper. What sets Deepgram apart from OpenAI Whisper is their deep learning approach which utilizes neural networks optimized for specific audio environments. They also offer models for different industries and use cases. Deepgram also allows users to train models on their own datasets, while Whisper is more generalized and does not offer the same level of customization on private data. Both companies offer a developer API which makes it easy for their software to be integrated into custom applications.

Deepgram uses end-to-end deep neural network learning that is designed for speech recognition. This is where a neural network is trained to perform a task directly from raw data without the need for manual tuning of parameters. This allows models to uncover the patterns that it determines to be important, instead of a preconceived idea of what we think is important to look for in data. Their models are set up to process data in this way, so all audio transcripts that are generated are run through their deep learning models to create a transcript. This enables their models to learn on their own based on the data that has been

They also use spectrogram-based processing, which is a method of analyzing signals in audio that involves creating a visual representation of the signals's frequency over time. Deepgram converts these audio signals into spectrograms and they serve as inputs into the neural networks. Spectrograms help the AI models to distinguish between similar sounds by revealing small differences in frequency and duration of audio. This helps the AI models learn even though human speech is often unpredictable. Because the AI is able to learn from vast amounts of data and recognize these small differences in frequencies, they can build accurate models to accurately translate speech to text.

## Landscape

Deepgram works in the field of Automatic Speech Recognition. This field involves converting audio into through deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Traditionally this field processed audio through Speech To Text Technology. This technology uses algorithms to process audio signals and convert them into text. These algorithms are good at converting speech to text, but they don't distinguish between who says what. These algorithms also struggled with the unpredictable nature of human speech. AI has advanced this field through the technology already mentioned, deep learning and spectrogram based processing. Because of companies like Deepgram and OpenAI Whisper, AI can replace the old way of converting speech to text, and add features that were not capable before.

The main competitors are OpenAI Whisper, Otter AI, Verbit, Speechmatics and Cogito. These companies show how the diversity of the Automatic Speech Recognition field, and the different business use cases each company aims to provide solutions for. Deepgram sets itself apart from these companies by their deep learning models, and their developer API that allows other software developers to integrate with their systems.

## Results

The business impact of Deepgram so far has been the wide adoption of Deepgram across different industries because of its ability to provide accurate transcripts and speech recognition services. A lot of their customers are in healthcare, finance, retail, and technology, which has already been mentioned.

The success of the product is measured by its adoption. Companies are using deepgram because of the low cost, the high accuracy, the high speed, and easy integration into new applications. Companies are also looking to adopt the latest features in ASR technology such as identifying different speakers, identifying different accents and still translating correctly. Because Deepgram has the most cutting edge technology to provide the features customers are looking for, they are outperforming their competitors in their product offering. This has led to high adoption across multiple industries, and it has led to them continuing to raise large amounts of money as they continue to innovate their product and gain new customers.

## Recommendations

There are a few ways that this company could innovate and provide unique services. One of them would be to develop a real time translation service, so that words spoken in a foreign language could immediately be translated into text into another language.

This would benefit the company because it would expand who they can market too by building on their existing technology. This would enable easy communication in international contexts, and could be used by international businesses, governments, and customer service calls. This service would continue to use the same technologies Deepgram already uses such as deep learning, spectrogram-based processing, machine learning, automatic speech recognition, and natural language processors. These technologies are appropriate because this is what is already being used by Deepgram for their speech to text product. By innovating on their models they can provide a solution that can translate from one language to another.
